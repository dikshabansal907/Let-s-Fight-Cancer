            <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>SHWETA CHAWRE</h4>I was fortunate enough to stumble upon a good support system and on time treatment. Many survivors unfortunately have to discover and research a lot of new and scary issues on their own.  They are not as lucky as I am. Cancer can do two things to you: make you stronger or make you insane. I believe I've felt both. But if God did this for a purpose, it's going to be pointless if I don't figure out a way to make the experience useful. Every bad thing in your life is redirecting you towards a good thing. Trust me, I have lived it!<br><br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/56">Tap here to read full story</a></div>
            <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>DEBJANI SAHA</h4>When you are newly married and diagnosed with cancer,it is easy for others to say that I concealed the disease from my husband before the wedding. People tend to ignore the fact that life is precious for everyone and no one wants to delay their treatment for months. Insensitive questions like “Will you lose your hair? Will they cut off your breast?”are thrown.I tried reaching out to people in desperation and to my utter shock found that no one extended their support. But this is how life is. Cancer made me strong to face this part of life’s journey as well.<br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/57">Tap here to read full story</a></div>
            <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>PRAGNA SHAH</h4>I went through 8 intense rounds of chemotherapy followed by 25 rounds of radiation. It was both a physical and mental torture, but the support of my wonderful family was unwavering. After my first chemo, when my hair began shedding, I shaved my head. My husband called me ‘bald and beautiful,’ making me feel lovelier than ever. My son also made it a point to tell me how strong I was. He said “Just wait Mummy. One day you will run a marathon!”I request all my female friends to go for regular health check-ups.Now,each day is a gift of new life to me. <br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/58">Tap here to read full story</a></div>
            <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>LAKSHMI KHANAGAR</h4>Lakshmi not only lives each day as it comes but also helps her family stay strong. Cancer may have made her world fall apart, but Lakshmi has picked up the pieces fast and put her life back together. Some days she succeeds, and some days she doesn’t, but she takes it all on with a smile. Every time she felt like giving up, she’s held on a little longer. Moreover, that is the stuff that heroes are made of.I decided to take each day as it comes. I stopped working and stayed at home to concentrate on my singing career. In life, you never know what is going to happen."<br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/59">Tap here to read full story</a></div>
            <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>MSANGI HASSANI</h4>Cancer as disease often invokes fear amongst us. It is often considered to be a one-way road, and there are times when people give up before even deciding to fight it. In the case of Msangi, he often attributes his inner strength to the way he sees life.“I mean if it’s raining, it’s raining. If it’s sunny, it’s sunny. So is cancer. It is important that we accept it and fight it right away, rather than brood in one corner.” He says.It’s been five years since his treatment, and Msangi remains more than jubilant as he makes his 4th trip for a regular check-up in India.<br><br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/60">Tap here to read full story</a></div>
            <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>SIDHARTH GHOSH</h4>Sidharth cites two role models, who inspired his drive to recover. “Yuvraj Singh and Lance Armstrong". Unfortunately,people are still unwilling to share their stories because they still feel there is a huge stigma attached to cancer.I kept telling myself that if two of the fittest men in their respective countries can get cancer, fight it, and get back to their peak fitness levels, then I could too.”He single-mindedly built that up to a brisk walk and eight months after his surgery, he ran a half marathon. And exactly one year later,in Jan 2015, he ran the full marathon.<br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/61"><br>Tap here to read full story</a></div>
  <div class="carousel-cell"><h4>AYESHA</h4>When Ayesha, a naughty two-and-a-half-year-old was diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, a rare form of blood cancer, the family felt like someone had pulled the rug from under their feet. It was unimaginable for one to see a little child suffer through such a disease.
      However, as reality set in, Ayesha’s family started finding support in their friends and family. With absolutely zero exposure to the illness within the immediate family, they relied on a close friend who recommended them to visit HCG.<br><br><a href="https://www.hcgoncology.com/blog-inner/64">Tap here to read full story</a></div>
